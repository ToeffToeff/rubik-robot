# rubik-solver

[jmendeth](https://github.com/jmendeth) and [Twinone](https://github.com/twinone)'s effor on a Rubik's Cube solver.

The aim is to make a low cost 3D printable robot that can solve the Rubik's Cube on it's own.

To accomplish our task we'll need:
* An Android phone to read the cube's unsolved state.
* A 3D printer to print the parts
* Servos to perform the actual solving

# Web simulator
There is a Rubik's Cube web simulator at http://twinone.github.io/rubik-solver
