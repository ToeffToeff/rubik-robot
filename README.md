# rubik-solver

[@jmendeth](https://github.com/jmendeth) and [@twinone](https://github.com/twinone)'s effort on a Rubik's Cube solver.

The aim of this project is to make a low cost, 3D printable robot that can solve the Rubik's Cube on its own.

To accomplish our task we'll need:
* An Android phone to read the cube's unsolved state.
* A 3D printer to print the parts
* Servos to perform the actual solving

## Web simulator

There is a completely functional Rubik's Cube web simulator and solver at: http://twinone.github.io/rubik-solver/web
